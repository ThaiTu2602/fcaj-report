## Event Highlights

### 1. Connecting Godot Client with AWS WebSockets for Multiplayer Games (Nguyen Quoc Bao)
*   **Serverless Bi-directional Architecture**: Harnesses AWS API Gateway WebSockets to maintain persistent connections with minimal latency, backed by AWS Lambda for game logic and Amazon DynamoDB for real-time game state tracking.
*   **Godot Engine Integration**: Implements the `WebSocketPeer` class and optimizes the `_process` loop to guarantee instant data packet delivery and real-time multiplayer synchronization.
*   **Practical Mitigations**: Shares methods to control DynamoDB query costs and implement garbage collection for "stale" connections in database records to prevent resource leakage.

### 2. Containerization Technology with Docker (Bao Huynh)
*   **Comprehensive Packaging Solution**: Bundles applications with all their libraries, configurations, and dependencies into a single Docker Image to eradicate the "it works on my machine" issue.
*   **Resource Optimization**: Shares the host operating system kernel instead of running a full guest OS (like VMs), allowing containers to boot in seconds and consume minimal CPU and memory.
*   **Accelerated CI/CD & Microservices**: Empowers rapid development and deployment automation through three key components: Dockerfiles (build recipes), Docker Images (read-only templates), and Docker Containers (active runtime instances).

### 3. GraphRAG Solution with Amazon Bedrock and Neptune (Viet Phat)
*   **Enhancing Traditional RAG**: Constructs Knowledge Graphs to allow LLMs to perform complex multi-hop reasoning queries and map deep entity relationships.
*   **Dual Deployment Paths**:
     *   **Fully Managed**: Employs Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases integrated with Neptune Analytics for fast deployment.
     *   **Custom**: Employs LlamaIndex to build customized ETL pipelines, allowing direct Cypher query executions on Amazon Neptune for maximum flexibility.

### 4. Machine Learning-based Network Intrusion Detection System (Le Hoang Gia Dai)
*   **Hybrid Security Approach**: Integrates rule-based AWS WAF with Machine Learning algorithms to identify anomalous behaviors and Zero-day attacks that traditional firewalls overlook.
*   **Model Training Process**: Leverages the CSE-CIC-IDS2018 dataset to train ML models to accurately classify attacks like Botnets, DoS, DDoS, and Brute Force.
*   **Detection Optimization**: Uses advanced data balancing techniques to enhance model sensitivity to minority attack classes and interfaces with a real-time visualization Dashboard.

### 5. The Art of Effective Teamwork (Truong Huy Phuoc)
*   **4 Golden Collaboration Rules**: Focuses on setting clear goals, aligning task assignments with team members' strengths, maintaining transparent communication, and ensuring strong personal accountability.
*   **Synergized Group Efficiency**: Promotes the "many hands make light work" philosophy to share tasks effectively, maximize productivity, and dissolve communication silos.
*   **Digital Workspaces**: Recommends platforms like Trello for visual scheduling, Slack & Discord for immediate collaboration, and Google Workspace for co-authoring documents.

### 6. Journey from IT Helpdesk to Senior Sysadmin (Tran Trung Vinh)
*   **Empirical Growth & Self-study**: Portrays a real career progression from basic desktop support (Helpdesk) to senior systems administrator, expanding subsequently into Cloud and DevOps.
*   **Mindset Transformation**: Shifts focus from fixing isolated issues to understanding systemic design, urging juniors to master Linux, Networking, and engage in continuous lab testing.
*   **Ultimate Sysadmin Rule**: Stresses the fundamental rule of production safety: "never test or experiment directly in a live Production environment".
